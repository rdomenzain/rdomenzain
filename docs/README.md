# Welcome

Welcome to my space. This is where I write about my projects, my thoughts, and my life.

## About me

My name is Ricardo Domenzain, I'm just one of the many programmer.

I'm a software engineer, I love to learn new things and I'm always trying to be better than yesterday.

I like to learn new things, I usually learn on my own.
